# ‚úã Palmistry Master Quiz (C++)

A console-based learning tool designed to help users memorize and master the interpretations of the four main lines in palmistry: Heart, Head, Life, and Destiny.

This strict "Stickler Mode" quiz demands high precision, requiring users to recall the exact readings for 19 common palm features.

‚ú® Features

    Stickler Mode: Requires a 75% Jaccard Similarity match on the content of the reading. Failure on any question triggers a complete quiz restart!

    Dual Modes: Support for both Sequential and Randomized question order.

    Knowledge/Skip Mode (-k): Allows users to quickly review questions and see the answers without the strict similarity check. The prompt changes to "Press ENTER to continue."

    Robust String Matching: Employs a Jaccard Similarity algorithm after aggressively normalizing user input (lowercase, removal of punctuation) to provide fair, word-based scoring.
