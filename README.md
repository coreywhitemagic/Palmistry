### ❤️ HEART LINE (1–7)  
<br>

**1. Goal in Love – Ends under First Finger**  
<br>
You hold high hopes for love. You have big ideals and a nearly perfect vision for what a true partnership should be.  
<br><br>

**2. Goal in Love – Between First and Middle Finger**  
<br>
You've found a great emotional balance. You are able to mix your deep feelings with common sense, making you a thoughtful and stable partner.  
<br><br>

**3. Expression – Curved (Arches Up)**  
<br>
You are warm, friendly, and naturally expressive. You find it easy and comfortable to show the world how you truly feel.  
<br><br>

**4. Expression – Wavy (Moves Up and Down)**  
<br>
Your feelings can shift or change often, which suggests you may go through many significant relationships during your life.  
<br><br>

**5. Condition – Deep and Clear**  
<br>
This shows you have great strength for loyalty and deep, lasting commitment. When you love, you are all in.  
<br><br>

**6. Condition – Broken or Has Gaps**  
<br>
I see a history of emotional setbacks here. This marks past heartbreak, separation, or a significant loss you've had to overcome.  
<br><br>

### 🧠 HEAD LINE (8–12)  
<br>

**8. Thinking Style – Straight**  
<br>
Your mind is highly logical and practical. You rely on facts, common sense, and clear, careful plans to solve problems.  
<br><br>

**9. Thinking Style – Curved (Sloping Down)**  
<br>
You have a deeply creative and imaginative mind. You use intuition and new ideas to solve problems, and this may indicate artistic talents.  
<br><br>

**10. Depth of Focus – Long**  
<br>
You are a deep, detailed thinker. You need to analyze all the information and details before you are comfortable making a move.  
<br><br>

**11. Independence – Separated from the Life Line (A Gap)**  
<br>
You are a fiercely independent thinker. You are bold, confident, and you make your own plans quickly without needing permission.  
<br><br>

**12. Clarity and Stress – Broken or Has Gaps**  
<br>
This points to a period of mental interruption or a major shift in the way you think, often caused by a significant life change.

### 🌿 LIFE LINE (13–16)  
<br>

**13. Energy and Stamina – Wide and Curving (Large arc)**  
<br>
You have high energy, strong vitality, and great enthusiasm for life. You are outgoing and active.  
<br><br>

**14. Energy and Stamina – Close to the Thumb (Straighter Line)**  
<br>
This suggests a more cautious and reserved nature. You prefer routine, quiet time, and may have lower physical energy reserves.  
<br><br>

**15. Life Experiences – Short (Stops Midway)**  
<br>
This is a common line and it absolutely does not mean a short life. It suggests your life is dynamic and feels full of frequent changes or that you are easily influenced by outside events.  
<br><br>

**16. Changes and Challenges – Upward Lines Branching Off**  
<br>
These are wonderful! These small lines pointing up are positive signs of success, achievement, or major opportunities at that point in your life.  
<br><br>

### 🪄 DESTINY LINE (17–19)  
<br>

**17. Appearance – Faint, Shallow, or Absent**  
<br>
This does not mean failure. It means your path is more driven by free will and personal choices than a fixed destiny. You're adaptable and can find fulfillment anywhere!  
<br><br>

**18. Source of Influence – Starts at the Base of the Palm (Wrist)**  
<br>
You are a self-made individual who establishes a clear life path early and independently.  
<br><br>

**19. Culmination – Ends under the Middle Finger (Saturn)**  
<br>
This is the ideal finish, indicating long-term stability, success, and high professional achievement.
